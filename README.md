# ðŸŽ¶ VIBEVERSE â€” App for Nightlife and Music Lovers  

## Why does it exist?  
Because of the lack of music variety in clubs. People want to influence what they will hear when they go out, and clubs want to know what their audience is asking for.  
VIBEVERSE connects music lovers and clubs through voting, events, and an interactive map.

   - Users can browse and filter events by genre or location.  

3. **Event Map**  
   - An interactive map displays nearby events.  
   - Events can be filtered by genre.  

4. **Club Statistics**  
   - Clubs gain insights into how many users are interested in specific genres.  
   - Helps in planning music programs.  

5. **Spotify Integration**
